## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS/SCSS
- JavaScript
- Git
- React
- React Router DOM
- Google Firestore

## Goals
The primary goal is to build a reactive e-shop website to demonstrate the ability to fetch and manage data using Firebase, navigate between different components with React Router, and implement dynamic user interactions.

## How to use
To start exploring the e-shop, visit the homepage where you can browse products, view details, and add items to your cart. Use the navigation links to switch between different views and manage your cart.

## Implementation
- **MVP (basic requirements):** The website features a home page with a grid of products and a detailed product page allowing item addition to the cart.
- **User Interface:** The design is responsive, focusing on usability across devices.
- **Logic Strategy:** Data fetching from Firestore ensures real-time product updates without needing static data.

## Code / Important Elements / Design Decisions
Emphasized the use of functional components in React and hooks for state management. Decision to use Firestore was driven by the need for real-time data updates and easy scalability.

## Issues & Bugs
Currently addressing an error with the functions related to favouriting products.

## Additions & Improvements
Future enhancements include:
- More attractive card components.
- A unique component for favorited products.
- Improved responsiveness and additional Bootstrap features for better layout across different devices.
- A loading spinner for better user experience during data fetch.
- Integration of Stripe for test mode transactions.

## Learning Highlights
This project has been instrumental in understanding React's lifecycle, the importance of state management, and the complexities of integrating a NoSQL database like Firestore.
